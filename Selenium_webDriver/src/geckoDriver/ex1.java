/*What is GeckoDriver?
 * it is a link between Selenium tests and the Firefox browser. 
 * GeckoDriver is a proxy which helps to communicate with the Gecko-based browsers (e.g. Firefox)
 
 * WHY Gecko Driver?Hence we cannot use Selenium2 with the latest versions of Firefox. So we need Selenium3.
 * Selenium3 can directly interact with the Firefox browser using a proxy,
 *  which is nothing but the GeckoDriver.
